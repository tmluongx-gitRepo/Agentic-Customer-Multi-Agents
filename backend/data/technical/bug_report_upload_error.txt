BUG REPORT: FILE UPLOAD ERROR 500

Bug ID: BUG-2025-1103
Status: RESOLVED
Priority: High
Reported: November 1, 2025
Resolved: November 2, 2025
Type: Bug Report

DESCRIPTION:
Users experiencing intermittent HTTP 500 errors when uploading files larger than 50MB through the web interface.

AFFECTED VERSIONS:
- Web App: v3.2.1
- API: v2.8.0

SYMPTOMS:
- File upload progress bar reaches 100%
- "Internal Server Error (500)" displayed
- File does not appear in file list
- No error details shown to user
- Occurs approximately 30% of the time for files > 50MB

REPRODUCTION STEPS:
1. Log in to web application
2. Navigate to any project
3. Attempt to upload a file larger than 50MB
4. Wait for upload to complete
5. Error occurs after progress reaches 100%

ENVIRONMENT:
- Browsers affected: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- OS affected: Windows, macOS, Linux
- Network: Both WiFi and wired connections
- Plans affected: Pro and Enterprise

ROOT CAUSE:
- Backend timeout set to 30 seconds for upload processing
- Large files taking longer than 30 seconds to process antivirus scan
- No retry logic implemented for timeout scenarios
- Error not being properly logged or communicated to frontend

WORKAROUND:
Users can:
1. Split large files into smaller chunks (< 50MB each)
2. Use the desktop application which has longer timeout
3. Use the mobile app for uploads
4. Compress files before uploading
5. Retry upload 2-3 times (may eventually succeed)

RESOLUTION:
The following fixes were implemented:

Backend Changes:
- Increased upload timeout from 30 to 120 seconds
- Implemented asynchronous processing for antivirus scans
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Improved error logging and monitoring

Frontend Changes:
- Better error messages for users
- Automatic retry for timeout errors (up to 3 attempts)
- Progress indicator for post-upload processing
- Option to background large uploads

Configuration Changes:
- Adjusted load balancer timeout settings
- Updated CDN cache rules
- Increased worker pool size for file processing

TESTING:
- Automated tests added for large file uploads
- Load testing with files up to 500MB
- Tested across all supported browsers
- Verified with 100 test uploads (0% failure rate)

DEPLOYMENT:
- Rolled out to production on November 2, 2025
- No downtime required
- Monitoring shows significant improvement
- Error rate decreased from 30% to < 0.1%

RELATED BUGS:

- BUG-2025-1095: Memory spike during file processing

CUSTOMER IMPACT:
- Approximately 500 users affected
- 1,200 failed upload attempts logged
- Email sent to all affected customers
- In-app notification posted

PREVENTION:
To prevent similar issues:
- Implement better timeout handling across all endpoints
- Add comprehensive upload testing to CI/CD pipeline
- Set up alerts for elevated error rates
- Review all timeout configurations quarterly
- Improve error messaging for all user-facing errors

NOTES:
This issue was initially reported through customer support and escalated within 2 hours. Thanks to the QA team for rapid reproduction and testing.
